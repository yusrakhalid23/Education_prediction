# 🎓 Student Performance Prediction System  

## 📌 Overview  
This project is a **Machine Learning and Data Science-based system** that analyzes a student's **previous academic records** to predict whether the student is likely to **continue studying or drop out**.  

It can be used by educational institutions to **identify at-risk students** early and provide necessary support.
